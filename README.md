# Binary Search CLI

This Rust project implements a command-line interface (CLI) for performing binary searches on sorted arrays. The program includes features such as input validation, logging, and saving search results to a file.

## Features

- Input validation to ensure the array is sorted.
- Option to choose between ascending and descending sorted arrays.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Logging of user actions.
- Saving search results to a file.
- Configuration handling.
- Custom error types.
- Managing search history.
- Command-line interface parsing.
- Additional input validation functions.
- Formatting output and results.
- Defining constants used throughout the project.
- Miscellaneous helper functions.
- Parsing different types of input.
- Generating reports based on search results.
- Measuring the time taken for searches.

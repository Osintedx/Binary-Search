# Binary Search CLI

This Rust project implements a command-line interface (CLI) for performing binary searches on sorted arrays. The program includes features such as input validation, logging, and saving search results to a file.

## Features

- Input validation to ensure the array is sorted.
- Option to choose between ascending and descending sorted arrays.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Logging of user actions.
- Saving search results to a file.
- Configuration handling.
- Custom error types.
- Managing search history.

## Files

- `binary_search.rs`: Main file that handles the CLI and binary search logic.
- `utils.rs`: Utility functions for logging, saving results, and checking if the array is sorted.
- `input_handler.rs`: Functions for handling user input.
- `search.rs`: Binary search algorithm implementation.
- `config.rs`: Configuration handling.
- `error.rs`: Custom error types.
- `search_history.rs`: Managing search history.
- `logger.rs`: Handling logging functionality.
